In the eighteenth century, under the leadership of Franciszek Placidiego, the temple obtained a Baroque style, but a century later there was a regotization of the interior. Famous artists such as Jan Matejko took part in the work, and he made wonderful polychromes in the church, as well as Stanis\u0142aw Wyspia\u0144ski and J\u00f3zef Mehoffer, who designed decorative stained glass windows.

Three streets pass from each front of the Market Square, only Grodzka Street, which runs along the old trade route, remains diagonal. The deviation from symmetry was the result of the location of the buildings already standing here: St Mary's and St. Adalbert. Krakow's Old Town and its center, or Main Market Square, in 1978 was entered on the UNESCO list as one of the first 12 objects in the world.
